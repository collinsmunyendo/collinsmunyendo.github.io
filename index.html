          <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I am a 2nd year Master student at <a href="https://www.informatics.uci.edu/">Department of Informatics</a>, University of California, Irvine.
            I currently work with <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/"> Dr. Anne Marie Piper</a>.<br>
            I received my B.Phil. at  <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a> in 2021.

        </p>

          <h1>Research Interests</h1>
          <p>
            My research aims to make technology more inclusive to people who are marginalized in digital environments, e.g., <b>older adults, d/Deaf people</b>.
              I have been mainly working on the following two questions:

            <li><b>How to improve digital and/or information equity among information- and/or digitally constrained communities?</b></li>
        I focused on collaboration within people's existing support networks (e.g., family, pre-established communities).
        So far, I have looked into <b>family support to older adults' technology learning and use</b>
        [CSCW2022 (1st author)], and <b>d/Deaf communities' support to the growth of online sign language content</b>.</p>

        <p> <li><b>How to improve equity and inclusiveness in online participation?</b></li>
        As a way of knowing about people, I often observe online social spaces.
        Therefore, I have also been thinking about equity in online participation.
        So far, I have focused on older adults active in online participation, to see how the platforms they use support their participation.
        I have examined two cases, i.e., <b>older adult content creators on short video platforms</b>,
        and <b>an online community where inter-generational communications are active</b>.
