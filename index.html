          <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 2nd year Master student at <a href="https://www.informatics.uci.edu/">Department of Informatics</a>, University of California, Irvine.
            I currently work with <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/"> Dr. Anne Marie Piper</a>.
            I feel lucky to be part of <a href="https://accessibility.ics.uci.edu/index.html">Accessibility Research Collective</a>.
            I received my B.Phil. at  <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>.<br>

          <h2>Research Interests</h2>
          <p>
            My research aims to make technology more inclusive to people who are under-represented in mainstream design, e.g., <b>older adults, d/Deaf people</b>.
              I have been mainly working on the following two questions:
            <li><b>How can we improve digital access from a collaborative lens?</b></li>
        I've focused on people's existing support networks (e.g., family, pre-established communities) to facilitate their information and/or digital access.
        So far, I have looked into <b>family collaboration in older adults' technology learning and use</b>, and <b>online sign language content creation within d/Deaf communities</b>.</p>

        <p> <li><b>How can we improve equity in online participation?</b></li>
        I see the potential of online social platforms to allow people to express their needs, build communities, spread their ideas, and produce community-driven solutions.
        However, many populations often seem invisible online (e.g., older adults), even though Internet seems to be an open place for all.
          Therefore, I've been thinking about how to improve equity in online participation.<br><br>

          Specifically, I've examined two cases, i.e., <b>older adult content creators on short video platforms</b>,
        and <b>a sub-reddit where inter-generational communications are active</b>.
