          <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 2nd year Master student at <a href="https://www.informatics.uci.edu/">Department of Informatics</a>, University of California, Irvine.
            I currently work with <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/"> Dr. Anne Marie Piper</a>.
            I received my B.Phil. at  <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a> in 2021.<br>
        </p>

          <h2>Research Interests</h2>
          <p>
            My research aims to make technology more inclusive to people who are marginalized in digital environments, e.g., <b>older adults, d/Deaf people</b>.
              I have been mainly working on the following two questions:
            <li><b>How to improve digital and information equity among information- and/or digitally constrained communities?</b></li>
        I have focused on collaboration within people's existing support networks (e.g., family, pre-established communities) to facilitate people's information and/or digital access.
        So far, I have looked into <b>family support to older adults' technology learning and use</b>, and <b>d/Deaf communities' support to the growth of online sign language content</b>.</p>

        <p> <li><b>How to improve equity and inclusiveness in online participation?</b></li>
        I often observe online social spaces to understand people from their self- disclosure and expression.
        I see the potential of online social platforms and communities for people to express their needs and build their communities to promote their messages.
        However, I found that many populations often seem to be invisible online (e.g., older adults), even though Internet seems to be an open place for all.<br><br>

        Therefore, I have been always thinking about how to improve equity and inclusiveness in online participation.
        So far, I have focused on older adults active in online participation, to see how the platforms they use support their participation.
        Specifically, I have examined two cases, i.e., <b>older adult content creators on short video platforms</b>,
        and <b>an online community where inter-generational communications are active</b>.
