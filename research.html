        <h2>1. Family Support to Older Adults' Technology Learning and Use</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Motivation</b>: Intuitively, younger family members are one of the major support sources for older adults’ technology learning.
            However, I noticed that there seem to be many challenges and tensions in the support process
            (e.g., many younger people do not support their older family members to use SVPs because they think older adults are vulnerable to online misinformation).
            To uncover the opportunities and challenges in family collaboration, I dived into the family dynamics during older adults' technology learning
            based on interviews with both older and younger adults.</p>

        <p><b>Results</b>: The work uncovered a typical family support pattern (see the Figure below), which highlights the challenges and tensions in family support
        that received little attention before:</p>
            <img src="image/support-process.png" alt="the family support process uncovered in the work"><br>

        <b>Takeaways</b>:
        <li>Let’s envision older adults’ technology use as a <b>collaborative</b> activity with family members!</li>
        <li>Younger people tend to show <b>unfamiliarity</b> with older adults’ learning abilities and digital literacy. They may struggle to evolve teaching strategies and tend to be impatient during the support process.</li>
        <li>Older adults may be far more capable of technology use than many younger people assumed. Out of desires for protection, younger adults may start to <b>check and even control</b> older adults’ technology use when they find older adults are far more active online than they expected.</li>
        <li>A special cultural context of “Xiao/XiaoShun” (usually translated into “filial piety” in English) has shaped a unique family support pattern in China and possibly similar cultures practicing filial piety (e.g., Latin America, Asia).
            <b>The findings challenge the Western model emphasizing older adults’ strong preferences toward independent learning of technology.</b></li><br>

        <p><b>Method</b>: Interviews with 20 older adults and 18 younger adults, including 9 families<br>

        <h2>2. Online Sign Language Content Generation Powered by d/Deaf Communities</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Motivation</b>: The project was motivated by the most reported challenges from the d/Deaf people I have connected with, i.e., <b>sign language information access</b>
            (check out <a href="deaf.html#deafChina">d/Deaf people in China</a> for more details).
           Due to the lack of official sign language information, many of my participants enjoy watching sign language videos created by and for d/Deaf people
            (I termed them as d/Deaf videos) for informational (e.g., COVID-19 information)
            and/or educational purposes (e.g., basic legal knowledge).<br><br>

            Seeing the potential and importance of d/Deaf videos to d/Deaf people's information access,
            I dived into the creation and sharing of these videos, showing how d/Deaf people collaborated online to power community-driven information accessibility.
        <p><b>Results</b>: We outlined an eco-system of d/Deaf people's collaborative content generation and sharing on Chinese video sharing platforms (see the Figure below).
            The eco-system shows the potential of video sharing platforms to support <b>d/Deaf community-driven information accessibility</b>.</p>
        <img src="image/ecosystem.jpg" alt="the eco-system of d/Deaf video creation and sharing uncovered in the work"><br>

        <b>Takeaways</b>:
        <li>Sign language content created by d/Deaf people can be important information sources and educational materials for d/Deaf people.</li>
        <li>I contribute a community perspective in design for d/Deaf people, i.e., researchers and designers should support collaborative work within d/Deaf communities rather than only
            focusing on designing for d/Deaf individuals.
            Such a community-based approach is important because it can <b>empower</b> d/Deaf people in information access (i.e., d/Deaf people can decide
            what information they can access rather than relying on interpreters). We also highlight the challenges
            that d/Deaf people meet in sign language content creation (e.g., language diversity, and possible microagressions) that may need to be addressed.</li><br>

            sharing is upon the permission of my collaborators.)<br>
            <b>Note</b>: <b>1) I involved a Deaf professional in our research team out of my desire to have d/Deaf communities' own "voice" heard. 2) I will continue this project, extending the findings
            into my Master's thesis.</b>

        <h2>3. Age-inclusive Online Participation</h2>
        Although older adults are often regarded as online lurkers and/or resistant to new technology adoption,
        many older adults are actually active online. I paid attention to the platforms where older adults are
        active in participation, to understand how these platforms support their participation while others cannot.
        I hope my findings can inform future design of online social platforms and make them more age inclusive.<br><br>

        <h3>3.1 Older Adult Content Creators on Short Video Platforms (SVPs) </h3>
        <p><b>Motivation</b>: SVPs (e.g., Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok) have a strong user base among older
        adults, including those living in less developed areas (see the Figure below).
            The popularity of SVPs caught my attention because older adults often seem to be online lurkers.
            Therefore, the case of SVPs may provide insights for supporting older adults' online participation.
        To understand how and why they are active on these platforms, I interviewed with 13 older adult content creators to understand their motivations and practices on these platforms.</p>
            <img src="image/svp_older_adults.png" alt="the videos shared by older adults on short video platforms" height="70%" width="70%"><br><br>

        <b>Results</b>:
            <li>My participants were strongly motivated to put performance and practice new skills on SVPs, because 1) the opportunities to develop their interests, and more importantly
            2) <b>the attention and support they received on the platforms</b>.<br><br>

            <b>Takeaways</b>:
        <li>Building on theory of Community of Practice (CoP), I took an affordance lens to analyze the design of SVPs.
            I argue that SVPs create an inclusive environment for content creation and sharing by <b>offering every video a chance to be presented on the recommendation page</b>.<br><br>
            The relatively low bar for recommendation provides older adults with chance of <b>social learning</b>, i.e., they can imitate the videos on the recommendation page.
            Older adults can also perceive the value and contribution of their works (i.e., <b>legitimate peripheral participation</b> in CoP).
            In contrast to SVPs, older adults often feel marginalized on social media platforms <b>dominated by trending topics among younger people and youth culture</b>
            (e.g., Weibo, a Chinese microblogging application similar to Twitter).</li><br>

            <li>Designers should help older adults <b>create and cultivate their space to develop their values and norms, and connect with like-minded people</b>.
            Otherwise, their voices may be diluted on platforms dominated by youth culture (e.g., the top 20% Twitter users own
            more than 96% of all followers and 93% of the retweets).</li><br>

        <h3>3.2 A Case of an Age-integrated Online Community</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="image/reddit-age.png" alt="people of all age gather together"><br>
            <b>Background</b>: Age segregation is taking place both offline and online in our society.
            However, recently we have found a sub-reddit where <b>inter-generational communications are active</b>.
            To understand how the place supports the inter-generational dialogues and why the community is age-inclusive, we conducted content analysis of the top posts from the community.
            We hope the findings can inform future design of online space, making it more inclusive to people of all ages.<br><br>

            <b>My Contribution</b>: Besides assisting in content analysis of the selected posts from the community, I engaged with literature on Reddit and traced the development of the community.
            I found that the creator of this sub-reddit created this space because <b>"he felt he is old on Reddit"</b> instead of feeling old in the real world. His motivation for creating the space
            immediately reminded me of my participants on the SVP project, who also feel excluded on a platform dominated by younger adults and youth culture. <br><br>

            <b>I contributed an understanding of how the design of Reddit may cause such age exclusivity through taking an affordance lens in analysis.</b>
            I found that many populations (e.g., female, and racial minorities) feel marginalized on Reddit because of its design. While the voting system of Reddit
            is intended to promote high-quality content in a democratic way, the dominance of younger white males makes the site only represent the values and norms of a specific
            user group. On the other hand, Reddit still empowers people to create space and rules for their needs and values, thereby making everyone can carve out and find their place,
            including older adults in the case we examined.<br><br>

    <h2>Ongoing: A Systematic Review of Conversational Agents for Older Adults</h2>
    <img src="image/PRISMA.png" alt="the five conversational agents covered in the study and the PRISMA process"><br>
    <p>
        <b>Overview</b>:
        With collaboration with another graduate student, I am conducting a systematic review of conversational agents (CAs) for older adults. Following the PRISMA guidelines,
        we analyzed 27 relevant papers out of 916 research articles retrieved from the ACM Digital Library. We have characterized the current design space of CAs for older
        adults with 5 key factors, i.e., modality, embodiment, function, personal value, and societal impacts.<br><br>

        <h3>An Auto-Feedback Display to Improve Work Experience of Crowd Workers</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="image/audi.png" alt="the interface we designed, which provide real-time accuracy to crowd workers to improve their working experience" width="80%"><br>
            <b>Overview</b>:
            Crowd workers are often disadvantaged because of lack of feedback about their working progress.
            We introduce a low-cost interface to make them better informed of their working accuracy.
            We make use of the website background color to provide in-time estimated accuracy to crowd workers.
            Results show that the interface can help participants reflect on their working strategies and provide assurance during their works.<br><br>

        <h3>Foodshow in China</h3>
        <img src="image/foodshow.jpeg" alt="a screenshot of foodshow" width="60%">
        <p>
            <b>Overview</b>: Foodshow, i.e., user-generated videos in which the creators mainly eat food (see the Figure above), is increasingly popular in China and other countries.
            Out of curiosity why people enjoy watching such mundane activities, we conducted interviews with 12 foodshow viewers. Results show potential of foodshow to be embedded in
            people's everyday life to serve their health needs.<br><br>
