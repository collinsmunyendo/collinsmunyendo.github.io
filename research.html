         <h2>1. Family Support to Older Adults' Technology Learning and Use</h2>
         <p>
             <b>Motivation</b>: This work is motivated by my personal experience and observation of younger people's attitudes toward older adults' technology use.
             Intuitively, younger family members are one of the major support sources that older adults can seek for during technology learning.
             However, I noticed that there seem to be many challenges and tensions in the support process
             (e.g., many younger people do not support their older family members to use social media because they think older adults are vulnerable to misinformation).
             To uncover the opportunities and challenges in family collaboration, I dived into the family dynamics during older adults' technology learning
             based on interviews with both older and younger adults.</p>

         <p><b>Results</b>: The work uncovered a typical family support pattern (see the Figure below), which highlights the challenges and tensions in family support
         that received little attention before:</p>
             <img src="image/support-process.png" alt="the family support process uncovered in the work"><br>

         <b>Takeaways</b>:
         <li>Older adults' technology use should be treated as a <b>collaborative</b> activity with family members that requires long-term relationship building.</li><br>
         <li>Younger people tend to show <b>unfamiliarity</b> with older adults’ learning abilities and digital literacy. They may struggle to evolve teaching strategies and tend to be impatient during the support process.</li><br>
         <li>Older adults may be far more capable of technology use than many younger people assumed. Out of desires for protection, younger adults may start to <b>check and even control</b> older adults’ technology use when they find older adults are far more active online than they expected.</li><br>
         <li>A special cultural context of “Xiao/XiaoShun” (usually translated into “filial piety” in English) has shaped a unique family support pattern in China and possibly similar cultures practicing filial piety (e.g., Latin America, Asia).
             <b>The findings challenge the Western model emphasizing older adults’ strong preferences toward independent learning of technology.</b></li><br>

         <p><b>Method</b>: Interviews with 20 older adults and 18 younger adults, including 9 families<br>

         <h2>2. Online Sign Language Content Generation Driven by d/Deaf Communities</h2>
         <p>
             <b>Motivation</b>: The project was motivated by the most reported challenges from the d/Deaf people I have connected with, i.e., <b>sign language information access</b>
             (check out <a href="deaf.html#deafChina">d/Deaf people in China</a> for more details).
            Due to the lack of official sign language information, many of my participants enjoy watching sign language videos created by and for d/Deaf people
             (I termed them as d/Deaf videos) for informational (e.g., COVID-19 information)
             and/or educational purposes (e.g., basic legal knowledge).<br><br>

             Seeing the potential and importance of d/Deaf videos to d/Deaf people's information access,
             I dived into the creation and sharing of these videos, showing how d/Deaf people collaborated online to power community-driven information accessibility.
         <p><b>Results</b>: We outlined an eco-system of d/Deaf people's collaborative content generation and sharing on Chinese video sharing platforms (see the Figure below).
             The eco-system shows the potential of video sharing platforms to support <b>d/Deaf community-driven information accessibility</b>.</p>
         <img src="image/ecosystem.jpg" alt="the eco-system of d/Deaf video creation and sharing uncovered in the work"><br>

         <b>Takeaways</b>:
         <li>Sign language content created by d/Deaf people can be important information sources and educational materials for d/Deaf people.</li><br>
         <li>I contribute a community perspective in design for d/Deaf people, i.e., researchers and designers should support collaboration within d/Deaf communities
             rather than only focusing on designing assistive technologies for d/Deaf individuals.<br><br>
             Such a community-based approach is important because it can <b>empower</b> d/Deaf people in information access (i.e., d/Deaf people can decide
             what information they can access rather than relying on interpreters). <br><br>
             The findings also highlight the challenges
             that d/Deaf people meet in sign language content creation (e.g., language diversity, sign language content moderation, and microagressions) that should be addressed in the future.</li><br>

         <p>
         <b>Method</b>: Interviews with 12 d/Deaf people, Content Analysis of 360 d/Deaf videos<br><b>Role:</b> Lead Author<br> <b>Status</b>: Under Review (I only share the general findings of the project here. The
             sharing is upon the permission of my collaborators.)<br>
             <b>Note</b>: <b>I will extend the findings into my Master's thesis.</b>

         <h2>3. Age-inclusive Online Participation</h2>
         Although older adults are often regarded as online lurkers and/or resistant to new technology adoption,
         many older adults are actually active online. I paid attention to the platforms where older adults are
         active in participation, to understand how these platforms support their participation while others cannot.
         I hope my findings can inform future design of online social platforms and make them more age inclusive.<br><br>

         <h3>Older Adult Content Creators on Short Video Platforms (SVPs) </h3>
         <p><b>Motivation</b>: SVPs (e.g., Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok) have a strong user base among older
         adults, including those living in less developed areas (see the Figure below).
             The popularity of SVPs caught my attention because older adults often seem to be online lurkers.
             Therefore, the case of SVPs may provide insights for supporting older adults' online participation.
         To understand how and why they are active on these platforms, I interviewed with 13 older adult content creators to understand their motivations and practices on these platforms.</p>
             <img src="image/svp_older_adults.png" alt="eight typical videos shared by older adults on short video platforms, including musical instruments playing, cooking,
chatting, travelling, and dancing" height="70%" width="70%"><br><br>

         <b>Results</b>:
             <li>My participants were strongly motivated to put performance and practice new skills on SVPs, because 1) the opportunities to develop their interests, and more importantly
             2) <b>the attention and support they received on the platforms</b>.<br><br>

             <b>Takeaways</b>:
         <li>Building on theory of Community of Practice (CoP), I took an affordance lens to analyze the design of SVPs.
             I argue that SVPs create an inclusive environment for content creation and sharing by <b>offering every video a chance to be presented on the recommendation page</b>.<br><br>
             The relatively low bar for recommendation provides older adults with chance of <b>social learning</b>, i.e., they can imitate the videos on the recommendation page.
             Older adults can also perceive the value and contribution of their works (i.e., <b>legitimate peripheral participation</b> in CoP).
             In contrast to SVPs, older adults often feel marginalized on social media platforms <b>dominated by trending topics among younger people and youth culture</b>
             (e.g., Weibo, a Chinese microblogging application similar to Twitter).</li><br>

             <li>Designers should help older adults <b>create and cultivate their space to develop their values and norms, and connect with like-minded people</b>.
             Otherwise, their voices may be diluted on platforms dominated by youth culture (e.g., the top 20% Twitter users own
             more than 96% of all followers and 93% of the retweets).</li><br>
