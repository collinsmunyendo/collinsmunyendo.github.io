        <p>My research is often motivated by my observation of people’s <b>everyday life and existing practices</b>, and I often pay attention to the <b>sociocultural</b> context of people’s technology use.
            I particularly enjoy finding design opportunities from people’s lived experiences and iterating my thoughts through the research process.
            Below are my past research projects.</p>

        <li>Family Support to Older Adults' Technology Learning and Use (Lead Author)</li>
        <li>d/Deaf People's Collaborative Content Generation (Lead Author)</li>
        <li>Older Adults' Online Participation (1 Lead Author, 1 Assistant)</li>

        <h2>1. Family Support to Older Adults' Technology Learning and Use</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Motivation</b>: Older adults often face challenges in technology learning and use, especially nowadays new technology is
            constantly evolving. Intuitively, family members are important support sources of older adults in technology learning and use.
            However, the support process is often challenging due to difficulties in teaching, disagreements upon technology use, etc.
            We dived into the family dynamics to explore the challenges and opportunities in family collaboration in supporting
            older adults' technology learning.</p>

        <p><b>Results</b>: The work uncovered a typical family support pattern as below, which highlights the challenges and tensions in family support
        that received little attention before</b>:
            <img src="image/support-process.png" alt="the family support process uncovered in the work"></p>

        <b>Takeaways</b>:
        <li>Let’s envision older adults’ technology learning and use as a <b>collaborative</b> activity with family members!</li>
        <li>Younger people tend to show <b>unfamiliarity</b> of older adults’ learning abilities and digital literacy. They may struggle to evolve teaching strategies and tend to be impatient during the support process.</li>
        <li>Older adults may be far more capable in technology use than many younger people assumed. Out of desires for protection, younger adults may start to <b>check and even control</b> older adults’ technology use when they find older adults are far more active online than they expected.</li>
        <li>A special cultural context of “Xiao/XiaoShun” (usually translated into “filial piety” in English) was highlighted to shape a unique family support pattern in China and possibly similar cultures practicing filial piety (e.g., Latin America, Asia).
            <b>The findings challenge the Western model emphasizing older adults’ strong preferences toward independent learning of technology.</b></li><br>

        <h2>2. d/Deaf People's Collaborative Content Generation</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Motivation</b>: The project was motivated by the most reported difficulties from the d/Deaf people I connected with, i.e., sign language information access.
           Through talking with d/Deaf people I connected with, I found that d/Deaf people in China face significant challenges in accessing sign language information (check out <a href="deaf.html">d/Deaf people in China</a> for more details). I also found that many of my participants
        enjoy watching sign language videos created by and for d/Deaf people (I termed them as d/Deaf videos), which can be significant information sources (e.g., COVID-19 information)
            and educational materials (e.g., learning about law-related sign language).<br><br>

            Seeing the potential of d/Deaf videos in d/Deaf people's information access,
            I dived into the creation and sharing of these videos to show how d/Deaf people collaborated online to power community-driven information accessibility.
        <p><b>Results</b>: We outline the eco-system of d/Deaf people's collaborative content generation and sharing on Chinese video sharing platforms as below. The eco-system shows the potential
        of video sharing platforms to support <b>d/Deaf community-driven information accessibility</b>.</p>
        <img src="image/ecosystem.jpeg" alt="the eco-system of d/Deaf video creation and sharing uncovered in the work">

        <b>Takeaways</b>:
        <li>Sign language content created by d/Deaf people can be important information sources and educational materials for d/Deaf people.</li>
        <li>We reveal design opportunities to support collaborative content generation to <b>empower</b> d/Deaf people in information access (i.e., d/Deaf people can decide
            what information they can access rather than relying on interpreters). We also highlight the challenges
            that d/Deaf people meet in sign language content creation (e.g., language diversity, and possible microagressions) that may need to be addressed.</li><br>

        <p>
        <b>Method</b>: Interviews, Content Analysis, Online Observation <br><b>Role:</b> Lead Author<br> <b>Status</b>: Under Review (I only share the general findings of the project here. The
            sharing is upon the permission of my collaborators.)<br>
            <b>Note</b>: 1) I involved a Deaf professional in our research team out of my desires to have d/Deaf communities' own "voice" to be heard. 2) I will continue this project, extending the findings
            as my Master's thesis.

        <h2>Others</h2>
        <p>Below are the other research projects I did during my undergraduate studies.</p>
        <h3>An Auto-display to Improve Work Experience of Crowd Workers</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="image/audi.png" alt="the interface we designed, which provide real-time accuracy to crowd workers to improve their working experience" width="80%"><br>
            <b>Overview</b>:
            Crowd workers are often disadvantaged because of lack of information about their working progress.
            We introduce a low-cost interface to make them better informed of their working accuracy.
            We make use of the website background color to provide in-time estimated accuracy to crowd workers.
            Results show that the interface can help participants reflect on their working strategies and provide assurance during their works.<br><br>
            <b>Method</b>: Experiment, Survey, Interviews <br><b>Role:</b> Lead Author<br> <b>Publication</b>: <a href="https://dl.eusset.eu/bitstream/20.500.12015/3254/1/ecscw2019_ep05.pdf" class="logo">ECSCW2019-Exploratory Paper</a>

        <h3>Foodshow in China</h3>
        <img src="image/foodshow.jpeg" alt="a screenshot of foodshow" width="70%">
        <p>
            <b>Overview</b>: Foodshow, i.e., user-generated videos in which the creators mainly eat food (see the picture above), is increasingly popular in China and other countries.
            Out of curiosity why people enjoy watching such mundane activities, we conducted interviews with 12 foodshow viewers. Results show potential of foodshow to be embedded in
            people's everyday life to serve their health needs.<br><br>
